                <h1><b>1.The Basic Food Tip:-</b> </h1> Eat the right number of calories for how active you are, so that you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use. 
                If you eat or drink too much, you’ll put on weight. If you eat and drink too little, you’ll lose weight. 
                The average man needs around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). The average woman needs 2,000 calories (8,400 kilojoules). Most adults are eating more calories than they need, and should eat fewer calories. 
                <h1>2.Start slow and make changes to your eating habits over time:-</h1> Trying to make your diet healthy overnight isn’t realistic or smart. 
                Changing everything at once usually leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan. 
                Make small steps, like adding a salad (full of different color vegetables) to your diet once a day or switching from butter to olive oil when cooking.  As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices to your diet.
              <h1>3.Eat lots of fruit and veg :-</h1> It’s recommended that we eat at least five portions of different types of fruit and veg a day. It’s easier than it sounds. A glass of 100% unsweetened fruit juice can count as one portion, and vegetables cooked into dishes also count. 
              Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for some dried fruit?
  										<h1>4.Cut down on saturated fat and sugar:-</h1> We all need some fat in our diet. But it’s important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat we’re eating. There are two main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. 
  										Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease. Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as hard cheese, cakes, biscuits, sausages, cream, butter, lard and pies. 
  										Try to cut down, and choose foods that contain unsaturated rather than saturated fats, such as vegetable oils, oily fish and avocados. 
  										For a healthier choice, use a just a small amount of vegetable oil or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee. 
  										When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.
              <h1>5.Eat less salt:-</h1>Even if you don’t add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much. 
              About three-quarters of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces. 
              Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. 
              People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.

                 <h1>1.Choose activities you like:-</h1> 
														A lot of different things count as exercise: dancing, walking, gardening, yoga, cycling, playing basketball. 
														To make it easier to get moving, choose whatever gets you moving. 
														Also, choose an activity that fits your self-identity. 
														Do you see yourself wearing attractive clothes and bicycling comfortably to work, or wearing workout gear at the gym?                 
														<h1>2. Piece your workout together:-</h1>You don’t need to get all your exercise at one time. 
														Ten minutes morning, noon, and night can give much of the same benefit as 30 minutes all at once.                  
                 <h1>3. Keep it brisk:-</h1>When you walk, make it brisk, since this may help control weight better than walking at a leisurely pace. What is brisk enough? Walk as though you are meeting someone for lunch and you are a little late. 
                 You can also time your steps for one minute: 120 to 135 steps per minute corresponds to a walking pace of 3 to 4 miles per hour, a good goal for many people. 
                 If your steps are not quite that quick, trying picking up the pace for short bursts during your usual walk, on different days of the week. Over time, you’ll stride your way to a faster walking pace.
													<h1>4.Take lunch on the move:-</h1> Don’t spend all of your lunch time sitting. 
													Hit the gym or go for a 20-minute walk with coworkers, and then have a meal when you are done.                 
                 <h1>5.Turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone:-</h1>Cutting back on screen time is a great way to curb your “sit time.” Trade screen time for active time—visit the gym, or even just straighten up around the house

                  Many wonder why it is necessary to meditate after practising Yoga asanas/ postures. One of the many benefits of practising yoga asanas/ postures is the fact that it allows us to slip into meditation effortlessly. 
                  Meditation being one of the main aspects of Yoga, it's essential that we sit for meditation after practising Yoga asanas and pranayama; else it is like preparing our dinner but not eating it! In meditation one delves deep into the self. 
                  There are many kinds of meditations though they might seem different most of them are, in essence, the same.
